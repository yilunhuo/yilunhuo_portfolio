### Final data story (Part III)

The main audience of my story is people who are interested in electric cars and people who don't know much about cars but want to try a new lifestyle. I interviewed a total of 6 people, of which five have their own cars, and only one bought an electric car before, which was a Tesla purchased in 2018. This ratio is also echoing the ratio of electric vehicle buyers I showed in the story. During my interview, I found that not all audiences understand the two types of electric vehicles, so I added an introduction to PHEV and AEV in the beginning, so that all audiences can understand their choices in buying EVs better. In addition, during the interview, I found that three people all expressed their concerns about buying electric vehicles, so I added a part of the questionnaire, which clearly stated the pros and cons of buying electric vehicles for the audience to reference. In addition, I also visually beautified the whole story so that the audience can see the more pleasing composition.

The whole project took me three weeks. In the first week, I determined the outline of the story and chose to use electric vehicles as my theme. After that, I conducted a lot of searches on the available dataset and determined that electric vehicles are feasible as the subject. Then I used Infogram to divide the whole story into different modules, roughly determining which parts will be included. In the second week, I used Shorthand to draw the draft, and used Florish to make some of the main charts. After that, I produced my own interview script and interviewed 6 audiences within a week. During the interview, I recorded their opinions and be more clear about the changes that need to be made next. In the third week, I mainly modified based on the feedback I received and improved the entire project. First of all, for the chart part, I added two charts, one is about the emissions of electric vehicles, the other is a questionnaire chart. I also modified the three existing charts to make them clearer and fit the theme more. For the content part, I added an introduction to the types of electric vehicles, and provided users with reference materials in the take action section. In addition, I also annotated the pictures and links that appeared in the story.
