# 1. Wireframes and storyboards
In this part, I used Shorthand to further develop the story outline and relevant components visually.

# 2. User research and interviews
### The target audience you hope to reach with your story
My main audience is people who are interested in buying electric vehicles and want to try a new driving experience.

### Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
I will interview two types of people. The first type is people some friends or relatives that I know who are interested in cars, and the second type is people who have never expressed interest in cars on social media.The reason I choose these two types is that although people interested in cars will be more interested in my topic, my story also wants to provide useful information to people who want to pursue a greener and healthy lifestyle and driving experience.

### Your interview script
First of all, I will briefly introduce the main purpose of this interview to the interviewees and thank them for their time.

After that, I will show my story to the interviewees through screen sharing and get their feedback.

The following is my script:

1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 

2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

6. Which part of this story do you like most?

7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?

8. After the story, do you feel confused in any part?



### Findings from your interviews and changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified
#### Part I: Feedback

For each question, the following is the summary for each question

Question 1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 
I interviewed a total of 6 people, of which five have their own cars, and only one bought an electric car before, which was a Tesla purchased in 2018. This ratio is also echoing the ratio of electric vehicle buyers I listed in the story.

Question 2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

Question 3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

Question 4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

Question 5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

Question 6. Which part of this story do you like most?

Question 7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?

Question 8. After the story, do you feel confused in any part?
