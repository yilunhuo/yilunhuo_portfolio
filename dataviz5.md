# 1. Wireframes and storyboards
In this part, I used Shorthand to further develop the story outline and relevant components visually.

By clicking the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/ku2cnPZd3PEhcHDA) here to check the wireframe.

# 2. User research and interviews
### The target audience you hope to reach with your story
My main audience is people who are interested in buying electric vehicles and want to try a new driving experience.

### Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
I will interview two types of people. The first type is people some friends or relatives that I know who are interested in cars, and the second type is people who have never expressed interest in cars on social media.The reason I choose these two types is that although people interested in cars will be more interested in my topic, my story also wants to provide useful information to people who want to pursue a greener and healthy lifestyle and driving experience.

### Your interview script
First of all, I will briefly introduce the main purpose of this interview to the interviewees and thank them for their time.

After that, I will show my story to the interviewees through screen sharing and get their feedback.

The following is my script:

1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 

2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

6. Which part of this story do you like most?

7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?

8. After the story, do you feel confused in any part?



### Findings from your interviews and changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified
#### Part I: Feedback

For each question, the following is the summary for each question

Question 1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 

I interviewed a total of 6 people, of which five have their own cars, and only one bought an electric car before, which was a Tesla purchased in 2018. This ratio is also echoing the ratio of electric vehicle buyers I showed in the story.

Question 2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

All the interviewees said that they have learned more about electric vehicles after reading my story, and all expressed interest in buying electric vehicles. This shows to a certain extent that my story is convincing. However, three interviewees still expressed their concerns about purchasing electric vehicles, so I will add a module to provide solutions to some of the main concerns in subsequent revisions.

Question 3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

For the first chart, first of all, the y-axis on the right lacks a percentage sign. In addition, an interviewee said that the color of the chart can be brighter because the background is white, so it will be more attractive if a bright chart is used. For the second chart, first of all, because the number of EV bought in California with the rest of the states are quite different, so it seems that only a small part of the area in the chart is colored. In addition, it is best to use an integer for the labeling in the chart. For the third chart, most interviewees said that the chart is too small, so it is not easy to see the specific words in the chart. In addition, it will be better if show the specific proportions in each part of the chart.

Question 4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

Five interviewees said that they are very interested in the topic of electric vehicles to varying degrees, especially for Tesla, XPeng Motors and other currently very topical electric vehicles. One interviewee said that she did not pursue too much about driving experience, so whether it is an electric car has no influence on it.

Question 5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

Question 6. Which part of this story do you like most?

Question 7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?

Question 8. After the story, do you feel confused in any part?
