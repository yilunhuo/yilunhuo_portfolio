# 1. Wireframes and storyboards
In this part, I used Shorthand to further develop the story outline and relevant components visually.

By clicking the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/ku2cnPZd3PEhcHDA) here to check the wireframe.

# 2. User research and interviews
### The target audience you hope to reach with your story
My main audience is people who are interested in buying electric vehicles and want to try a new driving experience.

### Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
I will interview two types of people. The first type is some friends or relatives that I know who are interested in cars, and the second type is people who have never expressed interest in cars on social media.The reason I choose these two types is that although people interested in cars will be more interested in my topic, my story also wants to provide useful information to people who want to pursue a greener and healthy lifestyle and driving experience.

### Your interview script
First of all, I will briefly introduce the main purpose of this interview to the interviewees and thank them for their time.

After that, I will show my story to the interviewees through screen sharing and get their feedback.

The following is my script:

1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 

2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

6. Which part of this story do you like most?

7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?




### Findings from your interviews and changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified
#### Part I: Feedback

For each question, the following is the summary for each question

Question 1. Do you have an EV in your family? When did you buy it? 

I interviewed a total of 6 people, of which five have their own cars, and only one bought an electric car before, which was a Tesla purchased in 2018. This ratio is also echoing the ratio of electric vehicle buyers I showed in the story.

Question 2. If you did not have an EV for now, after this story, will you consider buying an EV?

All the interviewees said that they have learned more about electric vehicles after reading my story, and all expressed interest in buying electric vehicles. This shows to a certain extent that my story is convincing. However, three interviewees still expressed their concerns about purchasing electric vehicles, so I will add a module to provide solutions to some of the main concerns in subsequent revisions.

Question 3. Does the data visualization here clear and resonable? Is there any part need to be improved?

For the first chart, first of all, the y-axis on the right lacks a percentage sign. In addition, an interviewee said that the color of the chart can be brighter because the background is white, so it will be more attractive if a bright chart is used. For the second chart, first of all, because the number of EV bought in California with the rest of the states are quite different, so it seems that only a small part of the area in the chart is colored. In addition, it is best to use an integer for the labeling in the chart. For the third chart, most interviewees said that the chart is too small, so it is not easy to see the specific words in the chart. In addition, it will be better if show the specific proportions in each part of the chart.

Question 4. Is the topic something interesting to you?

Five interviewees said that they are very interested in the topic of electric vehicles to varying degrees, especially for Tesla, XPeng Motors and other currently very topical electric vehicles. One interviewee said that she did not pursue too much about driving experience, so whether it is an electric car has no influence on it.

Question 5. Is the logic here resonable? Do you have any suggestions for the order here?

All six interviewees said that the logic is reasonable here. The first part introduces the rapid development of the electric vehicle market in recent years, the second part introduces the reasons for choosing electric vehicles and the impact of electric vehicles on the environment, and the third part introduces some of the things that need to be done before buying electric vehicles. The whole story allows the interviewee to have a coherent experience.

Question 6. Which part of this story do you like most?

I received a lot of positive feedback about the images I used. Many interviewees said that my pictures are very attractive and they think my graphs look very enjoyable. In addition, some people said that I used a lot of data in my story, which made the whole story more convincing.

Question 7. Which part of this story do you think need to improve most?

First of all, for the data visualization part, in the third question above I have listed what need to be improved from all the interviews. In addition, some interviewees said that the current three charts is not enough, more charts can be added to make the story more convincing. For example, the first chart of electric vehicle sales can be transformed into a dynamic form to make it more attractive. What is more, one interviewee also suggest me adding a chart about market share of EVs with different brands. In the environment part, the impact of electric vehicles on the environment can also be made in to a chart. In addition, for the 'action' part in the last module, there are too many text, so it is difficult for the audience to get the useful information intuitively at the first time. Some interviewees  also said that for the action part, a part can be added to introduce different types of electric vehicles and different brands currently on the market, so as to give audiences more choices.


#### Part II: What to change next

1. For the graph. Firstly, on the second page, I will modify the picture on the right part to make the scrolldown picture occupy more space, which can make the structure of the whole page more reasonable. For the two pages "Why people buy electric cars" and "The increase in people's willingness to buy electric cars", the background pictures can be modified to distinguish the background and text parts. In addition, for the copyright issue of the image, the source of the image should be marked under each image.

2. As for the chart and data visualization part. For the current three charts, I will modify the right y-axis to a percentage label in the first chart. Also, I will change the color of the chart to be brighter. For the second chart, I will adjust the color distribution on the map so that more states have colors in different level. And I will replace the label above with an integer. For the third chart, I will adjust its size to make it more intuitive when the audience see it. In addition, I will write the percentage of different types of people directly on the chart. In addition to the current three charts, I will add a few more charts in my story. For example, I will add a chart about market share of EVs with different brands. In the environment part, the impact of electric vehicles on the environment can also be made in to another chart.

3. For the logical aspect. First of all, I will add a module about people's concerns when thinking of buyting an electric vehicle in the second module, and provide solutions for each concern. In addition, I will add a part about some introduction to different types of electric vehicles so that audience will have a clearer understanding of the types of choices they have.
