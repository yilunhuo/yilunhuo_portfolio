# About me
Hello! I am Yilun Huo, a student of MISM-16 at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I enjoy cooking and travelling.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn:
1. Critique data visualizations by applying critique methodologies.
2. Develop and present a narrative suitable for a subject audience for a selected topic that is clear, compelling and persuasive.
3. Conduct user research to ensure data visualizations and the supporting narrative are being communicated effectively.
4. Apply methods for explaining and presenting data, constructing and telling a story using that data.
