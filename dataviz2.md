## Heat chart
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. The following is a chart to show the General government debt-to-GDP ratio with years increase for each countries.

We have three data visualizations on this page - the government debt bar chart, the grid of line charts and a heat chart. All the data come from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. 

For the bar chart, it is easy and clear for the users to choose the data they want according to a certain year. If we choose a certain year, then we can compare the ratio in different countries in this year. However, it is hard for us to compare the ratio change between different years. For the grid of line charts, we can clearly see the ratio change trend in each country. And since there are lots of countries to compare, by using the grid of line charts we can easily show all the country information we need in one chart. However, these lines are seperated from each other, and it will be hard for us to compare the ratio between different countries.

In the third chart, I choose to use the heat chart to show all the information. The reason I choose this kind of chart is that we need to show the 'country', 'year', and 'ratio' in one 2 dimentional chart. And the sequential color will show the ratio information we need. What's more, by moving the cursor on a certain box we can see the precise information about it. I re-organized the order of these countries, the top 3 rows is the top 3 countries that has the highest debt-to-ratio, so the audience will find this more easily. However, this chart is not so intuitive in finding what the ratio for each box, and we have to use the cursor to see more details here.
