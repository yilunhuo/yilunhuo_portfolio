# 3. The data
In this part, I will show how to obtain the required data.The data for this project are mainly divided into two aspects. The first aspect is the development of the electric vehicle market and the development of electric vehicles market between different countries. The second part is people's attitude towards choosing electric vehicles and the impact of electric vehicles on the environment.

For the first part, I will mainly get the required data from the [EV Data Center](https://www.ev-volumes.com/datacenter/) and [Global EV Outlook](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020).

The data center gives users unlimited access to all of the xEV global market intelligence. This includes monthly registrations, vehicle information and specifications, charging infrastructure, incentive plans and battery delivery (in MWh), supplier and OEM models. It also have other databases, forecasts and reports. 

Global electric vehicle outlook is an annual publication designed to identify and discuss the latest developments in electric vehicles worldwide. It was developed with the support of members of the electric vehicle initiative (EVI). Combining historical analysis with projections for 2030, the report analyzes key areas of concern, such as EV and charging infrastructure deployment, cost of ownership, energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and battery material requirements.
